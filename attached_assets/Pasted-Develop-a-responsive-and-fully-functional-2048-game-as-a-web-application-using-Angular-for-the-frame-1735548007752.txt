Develop a responsive and fully functional 2048 game as a web application using Angular for the framework, TailwindCSS for styling, and MaterialUI for additional UI components. The application should include the following features and adhere to the detailed instructions below:

Game Description:
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game played on a 4×4 grid.
Players can swipe tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) to combine numbers.
When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a new tile with a value equal to their sum.
The objective is to reach the tile with the value 2048.
If no moves are possible, the game ends.
Instructions:
Framework and Libraries:

Use Angular (latest version) to manage the application structure and logic.
Use TailwindCSS for designing the layout and grid styling.
Integrate MaterialUI components where needed (e.g., for dialog boxes, buttons, or score display).
User Interface:

Design a responsive 4×4 grid for the game board using TailwindCSS.
Each tile should display a number and have a unique background color corresponding to its value.
Use MaterialUI to create a header that displays the current score, best score, and restart button.
Ensure the game UI is responsive and works seamlessly on mobile and desktop browsers.
Game Mechanics:

Implement swipe functionality for desktop (using arrow keys) and mobile (using touch gestures).
Write the logic to merge tiles with the same value, ensuring tiles merge only once per move.
Spawn a new tile (with a value of 2 or 4) in a random empty cell after every move.
Detect and handle game-over conditions when no moves are possible.
Animations:

Add smooth animations for tile movements and merges.
Use Angular's animation library or CSS transitions for creating these effects.
Include fade-in or scaling animations when new tiles appear.
Scoring:

Track the score and increment it by the sum of merged tiles in each move.
Maintain and display the best score (stored locally in the browser).
Optional Features:

Implement an undo feature to allow users to revert their last move.
Add a restart button to reset the game.
Include a pause button that displays a modal with game instructions.
Code Structure:

Organize the code using Angular's modular structure (e.g., create components for the grid, tile, and score tracker).
Use services for managing game logic and state.
Write reusable and maintainable code with appropriate comments and documentation.
Styling:

Use TailwindCSS for a modern, clean design.
Style the tiles with dynamic background colors and font sizes that adjust based on their values.
Ensure the grid layout is visually appealing and adaptive to different screen sizes.
MaterialUI Integration:

Use MaterialUI dialogs for the game-over and pause modals.
Use MaterialUI buttons for actions like restart and undo.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the game on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and devices (desktop and mobile).
Optimize performance for smooth gameplay.
Deploy the application to a web hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting).
Output:
Provide the following:

A GitHub repository containing the full project code.
A README file with instructions on how to install dependencies, run the application locally, and deploy it.
Documentation of key components and services, including the logic for game mechanics.
Additional Requirements:
The application should support progressive web app (PWA) features for offline play.
Follow best practices for Angular development, including linting and formatting.
Use semantic HTML and accessible ARIA attributes to ensure accessibility.
