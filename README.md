## How to Play
1. Use arrow keys (desktop) or swipe gestures (mobile) to move tiles.
2. Combine tiles with the same number to merge them and create a new tile with their sum.
3. Keep merging until you create a tile with the number **2048** or higher.
4. The game ends when no moves are possible.

## Showcase Objectives
This project was developed to demonstrate the following:
- **Frontend Expertise:** Using Angular and TypeScript for building robust, scalable web applications.
- **UI/UX Skills:** Leveraging TailwindCSS and MaterialUI for creating responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
- **Game Development Logic:** Implementing efficient algorithms for grid manipulation and game rules.
- **Deployment Proficiency:** Setting up and deploying a full-stack application on a cloud hosting platform.
